# Note this is basically a copy of the vpn_ping_targets.yml.j2, but
# is intended to to help the central metrics monitor if head nodes go down.
# reason has been changed to infrastructure_check

# Not really a template anymore, but is kept with templates since this file will vary in the future .

# The list of head nodes to check over the operations network to ensure VPN is active.
# This is a hand made list since it will change rarely and the fabric-hosts file has 
# lots of head nodes listed that are not active or in VPN yet.
