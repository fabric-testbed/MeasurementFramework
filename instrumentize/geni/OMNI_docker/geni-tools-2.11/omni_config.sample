# This is a sample Omni config file
# It tells Omni how to talk to various Clearinghouses.
# And by extension, which Experimenter credentials to use.

# Omni looks for this file in 4 locations, using the first found
# 1) The location given by the -c command line arg - as a full path
# 2) The -c command line arg as a file relative to ~/.gcf
# 3) omni_config in the current directory
# 4) ~/.gcf/omni_config

# Any given instance of omni makes calls to a framework 
# (e.g., SFA, ProtoGENI, etc..) to create slices, get slice
# credentials, and to find a list of authorized aggregates.
# This file specifies the control frameworks that you are
# a member of and the users that you want to be able to login
# to your allocated resources (e.g., virtual machines)


[omni_defaults]
# This section is for updating Omni defaults without updating Omni.
# Values in agg_nick_cache take precedence over values in the
# user's omni_config.

# URL for the SCS server
# May be over-ridden using the commandline option --scsURL
# scs_url=https://geni-scs.net.internet2.edu:8443/geni/xmlrpc

# Default initial sliver expiration times
# done by aggregate type / category
# Numbers are in days

# def_sliver_expiration_ig = 90
# def_sliver_expiration_eg = 14
# def_sliver_expiration_gram = 7

# Specify the latest version of Omni released, and a message
# Expected format is "#,Message" EG: "2.8,Omni 2.8 was release 2/1/2015". No commas in the message.
# If a newer version is available, Omni will log a message at INFO level.
# latest_omni_version=2.7,Omni 2.7 was released 1/14/2014. See https://github.com/GENI-NSF/geni-tools/wiki

[omni]
# The default control framework for omni to use.
# Override on the commandline with -f argument.
# This should be the name of a section that you define below
# Note you could have multiple instances of the same type
# configured, EG for different MyPLC instances.
default_cf = my_gcf

# The slice_users argument in "CreateSliver".  It uploads
# names and public ssh keys to allocated resources for login.
# Details on users should be defined in sections below
# users = Alice, Bob

# Over-ride the commandline setting of --useSliceMembers to force it True
# to force using slice members defined at a chapi style framework CH
# when creating accounts and installing SSH keys.
# Can also specify False to force ignoring those users.
# useslicemembers = True

# Over-ride the commandline setting of --ignoreConfigUsers to force it True
# ignoreconfigusers = True


# Omni will by default contact every Aggregate Manager listed
# by your control framework's registry/clearinghouse.  If you would
# like to provide a specific list of aggregates to contact, do so 
# here in a comma delimited list of of urls or nicknames defined later.
# e.g., a PL in Princeton AM, a PG in Utah AM, a test GCF AM, and 
#  an OpenFlow/Expedient AM in the GPO lab would be: 
# aggregates = http://www.planet-lab.org:12347/, \
#  https://www.emulab.net:12369/protogeni/xmlrpc/am, \
#  http://myplc2.gpolab.bbn.com:8001/, \
#  https://masada.gpolab.bbn.com:443/openflow/gapi/


# You can also tell Omni a single aggregate URL to contact, with the -a
# argument. In addition, rather than remembering the URL, you can define a
# nickname for the aggregate here. This is completely optional.

#------AM nicknames
# Omni defines a standard set of aggregate nicknames. These are retrieved periodically
# from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GENI-NSF/geni-tools/master/agg_nick_cache.base
# Put your custom aggregate nicknames here. 
# To see all available nicknames try: omni.py nicknames
#
# Format :
# Nickname=URN, URL
# URN is optional
[aggregate_nicknames]
# boston=urn:publicid:IDN+instageni.gpolab.bbn.com+authority+cm,https://boss.instageni.gpolab.bbn.com:12369/protogeni/xmlrpc/am/2.0

#------RSpec nicknames
# When you call
#      omni.py createsliver myslice myrspec
# omni will try to read 'myrspec' by interpreting it in the following order:
# 1. a URL or a file on the local filesystem
# 2. a nickname specified in the omni_config
# 3. a file in a location (file or url) defined as: 
#    <default_rspec_server>/<rspec_nickname>.<default_rspec_extension>
